# b3scale REST API

## Authentication

We accept JWTs for authentication.
A public key or shared secret should be provided
through the environment.


## Resources and Scope

All API resources are prefixed with the api version.

### Scope

The privileges of a request are determined through the
`scope` claim of the JWT.

The following scopes are defined: `b3scale` and `b3scale:admin`.
The admin scope is required for accessing resources outside the
current user identified by the `sub` claim.
